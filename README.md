# notMNIST
notMNIST implemented with simple logistic regression.
Accuracy is lesser compared to a NN model but considering it is my first model im happy!.
Extracting .gz files and compressing .pickle files I made use of the tensorflow example repository
The Machine learning algorithm was coded from scratch.
